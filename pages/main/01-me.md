# Who is the Working Class Hacker?

![](me.jpg ".img-thumbnail .rounded .float-start 500x500 Me")
Hello World! My name is Espen. I live in Norway with my wife and three kids. I was born in 1979, sold my first piece of software in 1989, got engaged in 2001, married in 2002, entered fatherhood in 2008, 2010 and 2013. 

Through the course of my life I have worked on countless software projects, spanning a vast majority of languages and platforms, and as a result I am fluent in many forms of communication. 

## Languages
I have written production code in a bunch of different languages. Examples in no particular order: C/C++, Pascal, Delphi, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ActionScript, PHP, Perl, Different flavours of Assembly, BASIC, Visual Basic, VBA, Classic ASP, VBScript, Shell Script, Lua, Rust, Go, Solidity, F#, and a bunch of others...

## The origin story

I got started out with a Commodore 64 that my older brother got in a trade. He traded an illicit substance for this computer. I think of this as the drug deal of the century. It came with a power brick and an RF cable to hook it up to the TV, and a cassette player. No disks, no manuals, no software. I was 6 years old at the time. And I would spend hours, days and weeks trying to learn as much as I could about that marvelous machine.

One day I found a book with games for the C64 in the library - yes a book! Back in the 80s paper was a perfectly viable software distribution medium. The book had pages with source code in BASIC, and your job was to type it in correctly, and you would have your game. There was always a problem with the code, either the original author had a bug in it, it was translated from another machine's BASIC dialect, or the typeset of the print operator didn't have the correct symbols. This led to a heap of frustration, but it also taught me the way of the programmer. You just fail repeatedly till there are no more failures to be made, and then - and only then you will have your running software!

That feeling when the game finally ran on our machine was magical! That feeling is the same feeling I still get once I get something to compile and the computer does it's magical thing.

## Departing from the C64
My brother sold the C64. Which made me pretty sad. But I got an NES for christmas, so I got into gaming. I had to take a tiny pause from owning a computer for a couple of years. I did however spend time getting my NES to do fun stuff. 

 Then one magical day I got my first PC, a 486 SX 25! Me and my mother bought that thing together using her Christmas bonus. She didn't bother learning how to use it, but I did. While I did use it to play games, and do school work, but my main hobby was programming. I created games, graphics, utilities and had a blast and learned a lot! 

 ## Demoscene
 Graphics, sound and music programming became a passion. I got the opportunity to join a crew that attended what we called "copy-parties". Officially they were named "demo-parties" because we didn't want anyone snooping around catching us pirating heaps of software. Now are called "LAN-parties", my kids actually think "LAN" is only refering to these gatherings, and I keep telling them we have a LAN in our house... oh well. Anyways, these parties had competitions, or compos, where we were competing writing demos. These demos were graphics, sound and music written in software that tried to squeeze as much out of the hardware as possible, to create the most stunning demo. There were many diciplines, we competed in 4k, 16k, and 64k. If you want a challenge for yourself, try and write something graphical in 3d with textures and sound with only 4096 bytes available - including libraries, textures, music and soundfiles!

### Example:
*an example of a worhole effect*

$ src="/js/demoscene/wormhole/wormhole.js" canvas=wormhole $
<!-- <script type="javascript">alert(1)</script> -->
<!-- <script type="javascript"src="/js/demoscene/wormhole/wormhole.js"></script> -->

This is a classic effect! It uses a texture lookup method and a cylindric projection transformation to create a tunnel. Apply some trig transforms and you're off on your cosmic journey...

## School
I was voted out of high school by the employees. So I decided to start working with development full time. I had allready gotten paid for consulting gigs by then. I sold my first piece of software when I was 10. Since then I had sold many pieces of code, gotten paid for fixing networks, printers and copy machines. So I thought that not being able to go to school would be an advantage. I could just work.

My first job was programming firmware for a computer that was hanging under a helicopter that did imaging of powerline failures. Since then I have done everything from drivers to gif-banners. 

So ever since my first experience programming a computer, I have relentlessly kept going on my quest for all harvesting knowledge from as many corners of this wonderful world of software developemnt.

## This blog
I plan on sharing my experiences on my blog, however I will need to finish the blogging system first... 
I may post a series on this blog about the development...
