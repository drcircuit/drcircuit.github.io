# Workshops

I have one upcoming workshop at NDC London 2024. 

The workshop is titled "A Game Engine Over a Workshop", and teaches you how to build your very own 2d game engine and build some games.  

I have one upcoming workshop at NDC Sydney 2024.

The workshop is titled "How hacking works", and here you will learn about hacking and cracking and how it can make you a better developer.
