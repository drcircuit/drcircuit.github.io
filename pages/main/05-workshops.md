# Workshops

I have one upcoming workshop at NDC Oslo 2023. 

The workshop is titled "How Hacking Works" and is an in-depth deep dive into learning and executing different exploits. The workshop is aimed at developers and architects who want to learn more about security, and how software gets exploited.
