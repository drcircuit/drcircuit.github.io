Hello World! My name is Espen. I live in Norway with my wife and three kids. I was born in 1979, sold my first piece of software in 1989, got engaged in 2001, married in 2002, entered fatherhood in 2008, 2010 and 2013. 

Through the course of my life I have worked on countless software projects, spanning a vast majority of languages and platforms, and as a result I am fluent in many forms of communication. 

I got started out with a Commodore 64 that my older brother got in a trade. I was 6 years old at the time. And I would spend hours, days and weeks trying to learn as much as I could about that marvelous machine.

My brother sold the C64, so I had to take a tiny pause from owning a computer for a couple of years.
I did however spend time getting my NES to do fun stuff. 

 Then one magical day I got my first PC, a 486 SX 25! Me and my mother bought that thing together using her Christmas bonus. She didn't bother learning how to use it, but I did. While I did use it to play games, and do school work, my main hobby was programming. I created games, graphics, utilities and had a blast and learned a lot! 

Ever since my first experience programming a computer, I have relentlessly kept going on my quest for all harvesting knowledge from as many corners of this wonderful world of software developemnt.

I plan on sharing my experiences on my blog, however I will need to finish the blogging system first...
