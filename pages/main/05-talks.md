# Talks 

These are some of my talks.

## Security

### How Hacking Works
Have you ever been curious about how to get starting with hacking? What skills are involved? Is really only reserved for the most elite developers, or can it literally be learned by anyone? This talk goes through several concepts including binary exploitation, web vulnerabilities as well as reverse engineering.

### How Hacking Works - Web Edition
Now binary exploitation might not be suited for everyone - even though it is very rewarding and fun! But nowadays most vulnerabilities reside on the world wide wide. So we are going deep into OWASP teritory and learning some key exploits in the webosphere - so saddle up and get ready to rumble!

### How Hacking Works - Workshop Edition (General or OWASP - your choice)
Now how much can you really expect to learn with a one hour talk? That is the taste, but the work is left up to you. So why not go for a 2 or 3 day comprehensive kickstart to get your redteam ambitions bootstrapped? 

### Quantumania - The armsrace of our time
Quantum computing is something I have worked a lot with during the last 8 years. I have followed the technological developments and paradigms and the development is maturing much quicker than we may have anticipated. The key risk here is that this is one of those rare times where being a late adopter may not be the best strategy. Let me show you why!

### WCHs Web Hacking Bootcamp
Now this is the intensive OWASP course that can span 1 day focused on some key topics, or up to 3 days to cover the entire latest top 10 vulnerability topics! Want to put your security aware coders up to speed, why not get into this immersive hands-on workshop to get a feel for the tools and tricks of the trade?

### AI Gone Wrong!
Ok, so AI is everywhere, and the brass is pushing us to move on it quickly. What can go wrong? This cannot possibly fail right? Well, wrong - and there are examples - terrifying examples! Let me take you through some of the most epic fails of AI initiatives, and give you some critical thinking points to even out the hype. Because you don't want your hype train to be a runaway train dumpster fire!

### Vibe Coding Gone Wrong!
Well one thing is AI in customer facing aspects, but what about the new trend of just "vibing" your apps into fruition? You don't need engineers right? You can just focus on requirements and push to production - job done! Well, that also has some pitfalls, let's explore some real world examples that show you why you still might want some skills in your production pool.

### Vibe Hacking Gone Wrong! (And why that is bad!)
So if you thought that AI efficiency tools were only for the light side of the force, well think again. Vibe Hacking is a thing, and it is scary as fudge! Script kiddies are now armed with nuclear weapons, let us check out the status quo and start thinking about how we are going to handle the growing powers of the dark side.

## Programming
### So You Wanna Be a Demoscener?
I cut my coding teeth in the golden era of the Demoscene subculture. It is an amazing place where creativity, ingenuity and get it done mindsets converge. Using hardcore maths and glorious hacks to create stunning audio-visual experience in a caffeine induced haze cramming to make the deadline? Ah that gets my blood flowing - even though the reward is just to see your work live on stage.

### You Can't Do That With JavaScript!
Pet projects are a great way to hone your skills. And why not go against the current to build stuff that only serve the purpose of keeping Crockfords Law alive? This is a run through on how I build three different 3d rendering pipelines in vanilla JavaScript - with no libraries or help. 

### A Game Engine Over The Weekend
This is also in the pet-projects category. Only this one is a bit more useful. Here we will bootstrap a project that gives you a 2d game engine you can use to build pretty good games in. All in the scope of one weekend! You will learn a lot of game engine staples, the philosophy begind it. This comes in two versions: JavaScript or Rust.
