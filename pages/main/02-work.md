# Work
My dayjob is at DNB Bank ASA in Norway, I work in the NewTechLab division, which is an innovation lab where we tinker with new technology.

We are very hands on and coding is a big part of our daily life. We build functional prototypes, and have an exploratory mission to do technology driven innovation.
