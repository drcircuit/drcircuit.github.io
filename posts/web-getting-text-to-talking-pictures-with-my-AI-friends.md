_Having some fun with my A.I. friends..._

A.I. is turning into a zeitgeist of our time these days - many thanks to the groundbreaking work done by Stable Diffusion and GPT-based algorithms. So I thought I would have some fun and set up a little project using my favorite A.I. friends: Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, Tecotron 2 and Wav2Lip.

So what are all of these A.I. things? Well, to put it short they are all examples of deep neural networks with different architectures. Neural networks are networks of what are known as perceptrons. A perceptron is a node in a network that receives a summation of weights, adjusts that sum with a bias value, then that result is sent to an activation function which yields an output. That output can go either to another perceptron or to a decoder to give user output. Now that doesn't sound all that amazing, but it models how your brain forms neural pathways when learning new skills.

Think about if you are learning to play an instrument. At first, the instrument feels clunky, and unfamiliar, so you do not sound very good. But you keep doing the same thing over and over again, and gradually over time, you improve. After a lot of iterations, your brain has built direct connections between all the functions in your brain and muscles that are part of that process, and you are suddenly able to play the same piece without any effort, and nearly no level of concentration at all. This is how you learn, and why you never forget how to ride a bike.
